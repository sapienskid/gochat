## LangGraph Agent Design

The LangGraph agent workflow will be implemented with the following components:

### Agent Nodes
1. **BoardPerception**
   - Processes the current Go board state
   - Identifies key patterns and positions
   - Analyzes the game progression

2. **StrategyFormulation**
   - Evaluates possible moves
   - Considers multiple strategic options
   - Selects optimal move based on game state

3. **ConversationGeneration**
   - Creates natural language responses
   - Explains strategic thinking
   - Responds to player questions
   - Maintains conversational context

4. **MemoryManager**
   - Tracks game history
   - Remembers previous conversations
   - Maintains consistent agent personality

### Agent Workflow

## MVP Feature Scope

### Included in MVP
- Single player Go game against AI
- Conversational AI opponent using Claude API
- Game state persistence
- Basic chat functionality with the AI
- Client-side move validation
- Complete game flow (start, play, end)
- Deployment to Oracle Cloud VM

### Deferred for Future Releases
- User accounts and authentication
- Game history and replays
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Mobile-responsive design

## Development Approach

1. **Frontend Development:**
   - Focus on vanilla JavaScript, HTML Canvas, and CSS
   - Implement client-side validation to reduce backend calls
   - Use modular JS structure for maintainability

2. **Backend Development:**
   - FastAPI for high-performance async API
   - Pydantic models for validation
   - SQLAlchemy for database operations
   - Containerized PostgreSQL for data storage

3. **AI Integration:**
   - LangChain for Claude API integration
   - LangGraph for structured agent workflow
   - Prompt engineering for optimal AI responses
   - Memory mechanisms for game context

4. **Deployment Strategy:**
   - Docker containers for all components
   - PostgreSQL persistence through volumes
   - Nginx for reverse proxy
   - SSL configuration for secure connections

## Technical Debt Management

To ensure maintainable code despite the tight timeline:

1. Focus on clear code organization and modularity
2. Document key design decisions and implementations
3. Maintain consistent code style and naming conventions
4. Create TODO comments for areas requiring future refinement
5. Prioritize testing for core game mechanics

## Success Criteria for MVP

The MVP will be considered successful if:

1. Players can play a complete game of Go against the AI
2. The AI makes valid moves and provides conversational responses
3. Game state is correctly persisted
4. The application can be deployed and accessed online
5. Core game functionality works without significant bugs
6. The LangGraph agent demonstrates basic strategic understanding of Go
